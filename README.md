This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Project -1 , under Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I have used Stack OverFlow Dataset for this project. This dataset describes the basic Questions related to our Career, Job satisfaction etc. 

Dataset is available at Stack OverFlow,2020. The link is provided below for the same.

This project focuses on answering following questions: 
“As a Python Programmer, what scope did you get today, and what its going to be by next year?” 
"Do you like yours job or Do you take yours job as Hobby, if yes then what age group and Gender you belong.?"
"Which age group got good experience in Programming and do employees prefer to work full time or part time? Discuss about countries too in terms of employment?"
Apart from this i have done few more analysis like "What is the major interest for Under Graduate students"?
